# AllProjects
This repository contains a collection of all of the projects I have worked on throughout the 
following computer science classes, followed by school at which I took the class:
Introduction to iOS programming: CODEPATH
(COMP151) Data abstractions and Problem solving with Java: University of San Diego

Projects:
  Flashcards project (Codepath):
      This project was completed over the duration of the course in which every other week we would add 
      functionality to a flashcard app similar in design and functionality to that of quizlet. My 

  NumOrder project (COMP151):
      This project was the first I completed in my COMP151 course. The program takes in a file input that contained a set of             numbers and it returns a new file with the numbers in order of size with all repeats removed.
  
  HomeWork organizer (COMP151)
      This project was the second I completed in my COMP151 course. This project utilizes three classes to organize user input in the form of homework assignments with a title, description, and due date. It implements a linked list to store the data and has a simple user interface to allow the user to interact with the program to input assignments, organize and display them and delete assignments. 
  
  Infix to Postfix (COMP151)
      This program implements three classes to utilize a stack data structure to take an infix expression as input and then convert it to a postfix expression before producing a numerical output.
